The operating system we tested the program is MacOS.
This repository contains the Geolife Trajectory 1.3 database along with a python implementation of TIDKC. 
The main database file contains a large number of trajectories (181 individuals, totaling approximately 
130 MB). To simplify the analysis, we have extracted the trajectory data for the first four individuals, 
numbered from 000 to 003. You can find these extracted data files in the Data folder.

The TIDKC algorithm is divided into two parts. 

The first part uses KME to map the trajectory to the first layer RKHS. After running the command:
python3 rkhs_1.py
the program will prompt you to specify an input (from 2 to 4), which indicates the range for reading data. 
For example, entering `3` will read all data from "000" to "002". After the KME process, the results will 
be output to the `IDK1.txt` file. Please note that `rkhs_1.py` must be in the same directory as 
the `Data` folder. 

The second part involves using the TIDKC algorithm for clustering. To obtain the results, run the 
following command:
python3 rkhs_2.py
The program will output specific clustering information and the accuracy. You can check the example 
image to verify that the program is working correctly. Please note that `rkhs_2.py` must be in 
the same directory as the `Data` folder.
